soundtest[.efm].pcm is from "Tune Up AV II" (RF sample provided by Gamn)

The .pcm files are both raw 44.1k/16bit signed.

It consists of several seconds at several frequencies (such as 50, 100, 500, 1000, up to 20k),
which is very useful for CX since there is a 500hz high pass cutoff filter, so 50 has no CX
companding.
